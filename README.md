**Config works for linux, and probably MACos (? perchance)**

- To use, copy following line into terminal:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Shugarry/nvim_config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

- Also, you probably don't want my git files so you can delete them:

```console
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```

***!!! Warnings !!!***

You need to have rg (ripgrep) for telescope to function correctly
